## 🎓 Learning Philosophy

This tool embraces **"beautiful contradictions"** - the idea that learning benefits from holding two seemingly opposing approaches in creative tension:

- **Deep Focus** ↔ **Broad Exploration**
- **Mastery** ↔ **Survey**
- **Specialization** ↔ **Generalization**

Rather than choosing one approach, the tool lets you dynamically balance both, creating a richer learning experience.
